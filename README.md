## Install the RTM CLI app

If you already have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed, this program can be
installed via `npm`:

```shell
npm install -g rtm-cli
```
which will install the executable `rtm` into your `$PATH`.

**Note:** RTM CLI requires Node version >= 7.5.0

Authenticate the RTM CLI against the Remember The Milk API. This will create a file called  `~/.rtm.json`, containing your apiKey and apiSecret:

    rtm ls
    
For full documentation on the usage of the rtm-cli app see the [RTM CLI Command Reference](https://github.com/dwaring87/rtm-cli/wiki/Command-Reference).
